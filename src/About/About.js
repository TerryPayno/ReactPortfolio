        <p><h2>Personal life</h2><br/> ​
 

When not at work I spend a majority of my time programming but that's not all that I do. I enjoy many things such as cooking, listening to music, Running and I used to be a bit of a gamer not anymore.<br/><br/>

 

Cooking is something that I love to do when I get in from work. I find it to be relaxing and you get to eat some delicious food afterwards!<br/><br/>

 

Music wise I like anything that is energetic mostly electronic stuff. I and my friends drove to the Netherland to go to a Liquicity drum and bass festival in July.​</p>
